# Create your models here.

# The maximum lengths are derived from data pulled from my words
# "database" (i.e. HSK lists) I determined the maximum sizes of each field there
# and decided that I would alow each field to be 50% larger in my database
# the max lengths in cedict are:
# traditional:  4
# simplified:   4
# pinyin:       27
# definition:   240

# a 50% increase means that:
# traditional:  6
# simplified:   6
# pinyin:       40.5 â‰ˆ 40
# definition:   360
